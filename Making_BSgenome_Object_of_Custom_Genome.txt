Depending on the size of the genome and your hardware, this can take between 2 minutes and 1 or 2 hours. 
By default forgeBSgenomeDataPkg will create the source tree of the target package in the current directory. 
Once forgeBSgenomeDataPkg is done, ignore the warnings (if any), quit R, and build the source package (tarball) 
with 

R CMD build <pkgdir> 

where <pkgdir> is the path to the source tree of the package. 
Then check the package with

R CMD check <tarball> 
 
where <tarball> is the path to the tarball produced by R CMD build.
Finally install the package with 
  
R CMD INSTALL <tarball>
